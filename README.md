  ## Description:
  Deployed: https://note-taker-app-bw.herokuapp.com/ <br /><br /> The motivation behind this project was to create an application where a user is able to write and save notes to more efficiently organize and keep track of thoughts and tasks. This Note Taker app uses Express.js to retrieve notes saved into a created database. The inputed note appears immediately to the side and is able to be deleted. <br /><br />  For future development of this project, I would like to add a time feature and a way to reorder notes.

  ![Note Taker Img](images/ScreenCapture-Note_Taker.jpg) <br />  <br /> An easy to use app where the user must enter both a title and description for each note. The application creates a database by what is inputted and appends it on the page. The information is saved in a json file and can be returned to at a later time.
